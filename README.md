# 2D and 3D datasets
Creating and plotting some 2D and 3D artificial/synthetic datasets from 'mlbench' and 'KODAMA' libraries in R language. This script outputs a single image containing all of the datasets from the same dimension (2 and 3).

New datasets can be added, just by inserting it's function call to the end of the 'datasetNames' list.

This script was created as an example, to demonstrate the datasets shape patterns.
